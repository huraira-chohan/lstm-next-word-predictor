# LSTM Next Word Predictor  

This is my first **scratch-built LSTM project** for text generation.   

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview :

- Implemented an **LSTM-based neural network** to predict the next word in a sequence.  
- Learned about preprocessing, embeddings, sequence modeling, and training loops.  
- Compared results with the official TensorFlow text generation tutorial.  

## Tech Stack :

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  

## Next Steps :

- Train with larger datasets.  
- Experiment with GRUs and compare performance.  
- Explore Transformers for next-word prediction.
